About me
--------
I'm a Cloud Engineer with a passion for building robust solutions, specializing in Google Cloud Platform and recently exploring the Azure universe (also used Oracle, DigitalOcean, and Proxmox).  

My background in electronics and computing gives me a unique, holistic perspective on tackling technical challenges. I thrive in fast-paced environments, keeping my eye on the prize while maintaining a sense of humor.  
Currently, I'm delving into Rust programming language – because learning is a journey, not a destination! I'm always eager to explore new (and old) technologies.  
When I'm not wrangling clouds and code, I'm a proud husband and father of two, finding joy in family adventures.
